# bowery for norns

An exploration of building dynamic user interfaces on norns, for controlling declared public parameters in crow scripts.

It's called 'bowery' as the initial idea is to provide configuration of the github.com/monome/bowery script repository. These scripts are some generally useful utilities that run on the crow eurorack module. Through this project I aim to define an idiomatic method for declaring parameters that can be modified by the user.

In addition to this edition of bowery, another is planned with a web-based UI, such that a similar technique can be applied to general purpose computers / tablets / mobile devices. Attaching crow to a device, visiting the bowery website, and being able to upload scripts from the bowery repository, while also manipulating parameters in realtime.
